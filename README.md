# Coursera's machine learning

### The programming assignments from Coursera's Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.

### Supervised learning algorithmsï¼š

- linear regression 
- logistic regression
- neural networks
- SVM

for problems where you have labelled data and labelled examples like x(i), y(i).

### Unsupervised learning:
- K-means clustering
- Principal Components Analysis for dimensionality reduction 
- Anomaly Detection algorithms 

When you have only unlabelled data x(i) Although Anomaly Detection can also use some labelled data to evaluate the algorithm.

### Special applications: 
- Recommender Systems 
- large scale machine learning systems including parallelized and rapid-use systems 
- sliding windows object classification for computer vision

### Different aspects:
- bias and variance
- how regularization can help with some variance problems

advice on building a machine learning system. And this involved both trying to understand what is it that makes a machine learning algorithm work or not work.

### How to decide what to work on next and debugging learning algorithms
- evaluation of learning algorithms, evaluation metrics like precision recall, F1 score.
- practical aspects of evaluation like the training, cross-validation and test sets. 
- diagnostics like learning curves.
- error analysis and ceiling analysis. 

This is a wonderful course! Thanks coursera and all the people worked for this course.\
