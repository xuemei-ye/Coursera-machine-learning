  Abstract:
Fireworks algorithm(FWA), which is proposed for global optimization of complex
function, becomes a hot spot in optimization field recently, caused by its
competitive performance. Boundary handling for FWA, which maps the out-of-
bound sparks into feasible space, is critical for its convergence efficiency.
However, random mapping rule, which is widely used for boundary handling,
always caused computing resource waste, especially for high-dimensional
optimization. In this paper, we propose three novel mapping rules to speed up
large scale optimization of FWA. Meanwhile, to evaluate the effectiveness of
the new rules, we compare them by representative nine benchmark functions on
different dimensionality scale. Experimental results indicate that the mirror
rule which we proposed, achieve superior performance for most optimization
functions.
